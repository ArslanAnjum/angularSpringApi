					<p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px">The most important
						role of PDMA lies in providing a platform for all provincial
						departments to come together and strategize management and
						response to disasters and calamities. PDMA also acts as the
						coordinating authority, which articulates the coordination
						mechanism between key provincial departments including Rescue
						1122, Civil Defense, District Governments and Police for immediate
						rescue and rehabiliation operations.In case of a disaster, PDMA
						not only oversees search, rescue and evacuation of the affected
						people, but also takes concrete measures to provide immediate
						relief, early recovery and long-term rehabilitation to them. In
						case of emergencies, the PDMA works closely with District
						Governments to organize initial and subsequent assessment of
						disaster affected areas, and determine the course of action to
						ensure long-term rehabiliation of the affected population.</p>
